Mission Statement
	Team Asia is creating an application for Penn State’s SRTE (Student Rating of Teaching Effectiveness). Instead of accessing it through Angel or Canvas, there will be a separate application for this web form. This application is targeting Penn State students to rate their professors in a feasible way. 
Technical Requirements
	For our IDE, we will be using Eclipse and implementing a spring framework to develop a web application. 
Functional Requirements
	The users will be students at Penn State. When the application is launched, the user must enter their Penn State ID and password. After logging in, there will be a list of the student’s classes. The user will select a class they are rating and the form will open for them to fill out. The back-end of this project will be analyzing the forms and getting averaged for reports.
